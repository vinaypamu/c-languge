/*
3	Calculation of simple interest.
steps:
1)declare 2 integer variables p and n to represent principle and duration in months respectively.
2)declare a floating point variable r to represent rate of interest.
3)declare a floating point variable si to store simple interest after calculation.
4)declare a floating point variable m to represent time duration in years.
5)print the following indicative message using printf
 "please enter principle,time in months and rate of interest"
 5)read the values of p ,n and r using scanf.
 6)devide n by 12.0 using / symbol and store the result in m, to convert time duration from months to years.
 Hint : m = n / 12.0;
 7)calculate simple interest using the below formula and store in si variable.
 si = p * m * r / 100;
 8) print si value to the user using printf.*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int p,n;
	float r,si,m;
	printf("please enter principle ,time,in months and rate of intrest ");
	scanf("%d%d%f",&p,&n,&r);
	m=n/12.0;
	si=p*m*r/100;
	printf("%lf",si);
	return 0;
}
