1) Write a program to store 32 (on/off) statuses in 32 bit space and access every bit separately and print without applying any bitwise operators. Based on given input of which light status to print, print on or off status.

2) write a program to store a date in 32 bit space, read and print the dates.

3) Write a program to store a hexa decimal integer and print each byte value separately without using any bitwise operations.

4) Write a program to print the number of days in a month using enumeration for the month. 

5) Write date validation program using enumerations. create a enum for datevalid status with valid / invalid as constant names (valid =1 ,invalid  =0) assign or return these values from date validation function .create a month enumeration.

6) One woman daily,notes down, the milk packet received status in a calendar , and calculates the milk bill at the end of the month based on this status.

Write a program to store the daily status of milk in minimum space, and calculate the milk bill,considering, daily quantity as 1 liter. 1 liter milk cost : 100/-.

Input is to be taken as a hexa decimal integer (0x7fffffff means milk received on all 31 days).


Do this using bit fields & also using bitwise operators as 2 different assignments.
