/*13. Write a functionsetbits(x,p,n,y)that return x with then bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.
e.g. if x = 10101010 (170 decimal) and y = 10100111 (167 decimal) and n = 3 and p = 6 then
you need to strip off 3 bits of y (111) and put them in x at position 10xxx010 to get answer
10111010. Your answer should print out the result in binary form although input can be in
decimal form.
Your output should be like this:
x = 10101010 (binary)
y = 10100111 (binary)
setbits n = 3, p = 6 gives x = 10111010 (binary).
