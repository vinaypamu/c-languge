1) Create a sorted linked list from the numbers entered by the user by finding the appropriate place to insert them, and thereby keep the linked list always in a sorted state.


Example:
user input: 3

Linked List: 3

user next input : 5
Linked List : 3 5

user next input : 4
Linked List: 3 4 5 ( insert 4 after 3, before 5)

user next input : 7

Linked List : 3 4 5 7

user next input : 1
Linked List : 1 3 4 5 7
