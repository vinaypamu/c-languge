1) Repeat command line argument string sorting program using swapping function using call by reference of pointers.

2) Create a two dimentional array (array of strings) using a double pointer and sort the strings alphabetically. Here number of strings, and each string size, both are decided during runtime. 

-read number of strings (number of rows)

- allocate memory for a character pointer array, for the given number of rows

- visit each row using a row loop.allocate memory for each string dynamically, assign base address to the character pointer array element. Read the string.

- sort the character pointer array (sort the strings). use string comparison function, and swap functions.

- release the dynamic memory properly, after printing the results. 

3) Create a two dementional integer array to store the marks of n students in a class (Each student takes different number of subjects) so the number rows and columns are dynamic here. Read the marks of every student and calculate average marks, and print who is the topper (with highest average marks).
release the dynamic memory properly after printing the results.
